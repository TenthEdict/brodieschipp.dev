        I built a multi-agent AI system modeled after chess pieces. Each agent has a 
        specialized role, a distinct personality, and a specific model powering it — chosen 
        for the right balance of capability and efficiency.
      </p>
      <p class="text-[var(--color-text-muted)] max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
        This isn't about having AI do everything. It's about <strong class="text-[var(--color-text)]">designing 
        a system</strong> where the right agent handles the right task, with a human always 
        holding the final move. Think of it as organizational design — applied to AI.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why Chess?</h2>
      <p class="text-[var(--color-text-muted)] leading-relaxed">
        Chess is a game of specialization, coordination, and knowing which piece to move when. 
        A rook and a bishop do very different things — but together they control the board. 
        AI agents work the same way. A heavyweight model for strategy, a lightweight one for 
        utility, and a human at the center making the moves that matter. The metaphor isn't 
        just cute — it's how I think about system design.
