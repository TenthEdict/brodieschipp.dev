        I'm Brodie, a master's student in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with a deep 
        curiosity for how systems (human and digital) actually work.
      </p>
      <p>
        By day, I work in the <a href="https://earchives.lib.purdue.edu/" class="text-[var(--color-accent)] hover:text-[var(--color-accent-hover)] underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Programs unit</a> of Purdue University Libraries and School 
        of Information Studies by turning history into accessible digital records for the world 
        to see. It's meticulous, detail-oriented work that sits at the intersection of 
        preservation and technology.

        By night (and most other hours), I'm exploring AI as a power tool — not just for 
        productivity, but as a way to think about delegation, autonomy, and systems design. 
        I've built a multi-agent AI team modeled after chess pieces, each with a specialized 
        role and personality. More on that <a href="/chess-team" class="text-[var(--color-accent)] hover:text-[var(--color-accent-hover)] underline">here</a>.

        My thesis focuses on how staff perceive organizational performance management systems 
        and explores alternatives that emphasize the importance of staff accepting the tool 
        that measures their own performance. As an underrepresented population in the empirical 
        literature, institutional staff deserve to have their perspectives help inform how they 
        are assessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the best tools disappear into the workflow, and the best systems make 
        complexity feel simple.
