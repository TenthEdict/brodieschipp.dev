        I'm Brodie Schipp — a master's student in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with a 
        deep curiosity for how systems (human and digital) actually work.
      </p>

        By day, I work in the digitization department of an institutional library, turning 
        fragile archival materials into accessible digital records. It's meticulous, 
        detail-oriented work that sits at the intersection of preservation and technology.

        By night (and most other hours), I'm exploring AI as a power tool — not just for 
        productivity, but as a way to think about delegation, autonomy, and system design. 
        I've built a multi-agent AI team modeled after chess pieces, each with a specialized 
        role and personality. More on that <a href="/chess-team" class="text-[var(--color-accent)] hover:text-[var(--color-accent-hover)] underline">here</a>.

        My thesis work focuses on the intersection of organizational psychology and modern 
        workplace dynamics — understanding the structures that help people do their best work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the best tools disappear into the workflow. The best systems make complexity 
        feel simple. And the best research starts with a question you can't stop thinking about.
